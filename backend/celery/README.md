## Celery
 - Celery is a powerful tool for handling background tasks in Python, and when paired with FastAPI, it lets you offload long-running or resource-intensive operations—like sending emails, processing images, or crunching data—so your API stays fast and responsive. 🚀

###🧠 Why Use Celery with FastAPI?
 - FastAPI is asynchronous, but it still runs in a single process. For CPU-bound or blocking I/O tasks, you need something more robust. That’s where Celery shines:

✅ Runs tasks in the background

✅ Distributes work across multiple workers or machines

✅ Supports retries, scheduling, and result tracking

✅ Works with brokers like Redis or RabbitMQ

### ⚙️ Basic Setup Overview
 - Here’s a high-level view of how to integrate Celery with FastAPI:
```
1. Install Dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn celery redis
2. Create a Celery App (celery_worker.py)
from celery import Celery

celery = Celery(
    "worker",
    broker="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    backend="redis://localhost:6379/0"
)

@celery.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
3. Trigger Tasks from FastAPI (main.py)
python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from celery_worker import add

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/add/")
def run_add(x: int, y: int):
    task = add.delay(x, y)
    return {"task_id": task.id}
4. Start the Celery Worker
celery -A celery_worker.celery worker --loglevel=info
```

###🔍 Monitor Task Status (Optional)
You can use Celery’s AsyncResult to check task status:
```
from celery.result import AsyncResult

@app.get("/status/{task_id}")
def get_status(task_id: str):
    result = AsyncResult(task_id)
    return {"status": result.status, "result": result.result}
```

###🧪 Real-World Use Cases
  - Sending confirmation emails
  - Generating reports
  - Running ML model predictions
  - Video/audio processing
  - Scheduled jobs (via Celery Beat)
